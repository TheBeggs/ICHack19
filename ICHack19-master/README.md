# ICHack19

This is our submission for ICHack19.

It is a piece of software that uses facial recognition to add accessories to every face present in the picture. It supports both live images taken through the webcam and files supplied to the program.

To run the program, you run the python menu file in the GG folder. This will bring you to a menu where you can select the options to be used. Press start and the program will run.

When running in "live mode". Pressing the letter 'p' on the keyboard takes a screenshot and saves it to file and pressing 'esc' will close the program.
